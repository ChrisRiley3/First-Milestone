# Chris Riley's Photography - Responsive First Milestone Project

Hello and welcome to my very first milestone project. This website will help advertise a photographers self made business, not only will people visiting the website be able to view the companies gallery from past events but they will be able to view the different packages offered, pricing of each package and reviews left by past clients. no matter what platform they may be using as this website is fully responsive.  

# UX

This project uses skills i have learnt throughout the course so far to create a mobile-first responsive website for a freelance photographer to help adivertise their work and to take on more booking and eventually a proper way to manage their bookings. This website is also for potential clients who are looking to hire a photographer for a event. By creating this website i am not only helping the photographer to achieve their goals by increasing their client base but also providing details and photos of the photographer's work so potential clients can hire them. For example: 

* A user wanted to view the portfolio of the photographers past work, in which case they can by browsing the portfolio section on the website. By clicking portfolio in the nav bar the user will be met with another dropdown menu where they can they ether click wedding or parties. This will then take them to the page they wish to view. 

* A user wanted to know the contact details to get in touch with the photographer this is found on the home page but also a form was created and placed at the bottom of the pricing page for people who want to leave their details so the photographer can get back in touch with them

* A user wanted to read reviews on the photographers past work. All they will need to do is simply use the nav bar to open the portfolio section and then click reviews

* The majorities of users visiting the website will be looking at pricing. The pricing page is designed is a chronological order so that the first package is the most expensive and they decrease in price as you move further down the page.

# Features

* Navigation feature - This allows the user to navigate round the whole website no matter what page they are on, this is also fully responsive so that for smaller devices the navigation will go into a dropdown (hamburger) menu. 

* Footer feature - The footer allows the users to view the companies social media sites. However these links arent functional yet but will be in a later feature.

* Form feature - There is a working form which will allow the user to enter their name, phone, email and which package they are interested in so the company can get back in touch with them. However the form is not fully functional as it will not alert anyone that a form has been filled out and also it will not be logged on a database.

* Portfolio feature - This allows the photographer to showcase their portfolio for future clients. 

* Review feature - This allows potential clients to read reviews on the company 

* Pricing feature - This allows potential clients to view the different packages the company offers all set out in a simple way for easy navigation

### Future Features 

* More categories will added to the portfolio dropdown e.g. charity events, christening's, portraits, landscape prints, commercial work and video

* A FAQ page will be added to the navigation bar, this will display frequently asked questions so the users may find quick answers to their questions that other users have previously asked before 

* Make the social links in the footer fully functional so that when clicked they navigate you over to the social media site in a separate window 

* A log in section so as well as clients getting their photos in hard copy they will also be able to sign into their account on the website and give out a code to allow people who attended the event to view the pictures online.

* a review form will be added so the clients can leave reviews on the website 

* In the portfolio section specifically the images on the webpage at the moment they only scale down to show some sort of interaction when the user hovers over them in the future i want them to scale up with a nice affect when they are clicked.

# Testing

Once i was happy with my code is used w3c validator for my html and css to check my code was legal and valid. There were a few minor adjustments needed such as a paragraph tag that wasnt needed no major adjustments were needed. to do this sort of testing i copy and pasted my code into [https://validator.w3.org/] and for css [https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/] once on these websites i clicked the "by direct input" button and copied my code in the box provided then clicked check. If there are any problems with the code this will then show under the code so you can go back and fix it. 

Each one of my pages was tested locally to make sure every feature i put into the project worked how it should at this stage of the course. Once you access the website i have made sure it is as easy as possible to navigate your way round. I tested that the user can scroll down the page to view the contact me section. I have tested each navigation item by simply clicking them and making sure that they take you to the designated page that you are looking for. If you navigate your way over to the portfolio section you will see that on desktop and mobile view dropdown menu works so the user can view the companies portfolio. If a user clicks the review page it will take them to that page so they can look at previous reviews made. When creating the website i always created it in mobile view and then worked my way up to desktop this way you have a fully functioning mobile first responsive website. I have tested the look and feel of the website not only on desktop but on Iphone X, Ipad, Ipad Pro, Galaxy s5, Pixel 2, Pixel 2XL, Iphone 6,7,8, Iphone 6,7,8 Plus ect. 

Certain links have a hover affect so when the user hovers over them they know there is interaction there, this could be the scale changes or color. I have tested all of these to make sure they are all functioning properly so when you hover over amy navigation item it will grow in size and also a slight color change will happen. Images in the portfolio section also change in scale to show some interaction when the user hovers over them.

# Deployment 

This website was coded in Visual Studio Code and a local git directory was used for version control i initilised a new git repository by using the command git init. I then when over to git hub and created a new repository called First-Milestone [https://github.com/ChrisRiley3/First-Milestone]. Once i had completed a section of the course i pushed it to my new github repository using git push in the command line. Once it was in github repository i could then make the site live using github pages. This site can be found at [https://chrisriley3.github.io/First-Milestone/]
